# Fluuter Movie App

In this project I have use Movie Api to Fetch data from the api.

You can also change page on clicking anywhere on the app except show details bottom and "Star Movie App" title.

When you click on "Star Movie App" title page will go down and on first page it will show snackbar "Already on First Page".

Dependenices Used in this app are,
1. Google Fonts
2. Http 
3. Rating Bar
4. Slidable 

The App will display you the main page along with fresh/modren UI and on clicking Show details you will be redirected to another screen where details of same movie 
will be displayed to you.

I have add scrollable description section so you will not have to scroll all the way down to see other options.

Rating also perform important roll in all this you can check the code.

I have divided the code into mulitple folders to make it better in performance and to understand.
